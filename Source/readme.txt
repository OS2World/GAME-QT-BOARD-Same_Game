Qt implementation of SameGame

    SameGame is a puzzle game for Linux and Windows. The rules of the game are as follows:

        1. You may remove pieces provided at least two are adjacent either horizontally or vertically.
        2. Let n = number of removed pieces. Then score += (n-1)Â².
        3. If you remove all pieces, your score will be doubled.
        4. The game ends when you have removed all pieces or there are no removable pieces.
