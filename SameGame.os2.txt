Welcome to SameGame 1.1.0 port for OS/2 and eComStation.

SameGame is a puzzle game for Linux and Windows. The rules of the game are as
follows:

  1. You may remove pieces provided at least two are adjacent either
     horizontally or vertically.
  2. Let n = number of removed pieces. Then score += (n-1)ý.
  3. If you remove all pieces, your score will be doubled.
  4. The game ends when you have removed all pieces or there are no removable
     pieces.

NOTE: this port includes a OS/2 icon, a Windows icon and a spanish translation.
